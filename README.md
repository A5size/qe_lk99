# What is this?
This is a collection of input files for conducting band structure calculations of LK-99 using Quantum Espresso. The calculation parameters are based on https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.16040. It has been tested on Ubuntu, with the machine specifications detailed below. Please be aware that I am a novice in this field and cannot guarantee the accuracy of these calculations.

# Install Quantum Espresso
The following are instructions on how to install Quantum Espresso. Feel free to adjust them to suit your specific environment.
```sh
% git clone https://github.com/QEF/q-e.git
% cd q-e
% ./configure
% make all
```

# Clone this repository
```sh
% git clone https://github.com/A5size/qe_lk99.git
```

# Run
Running run.sh will initiate a sequence of calculations, ending with the band structure calculation. Before executing run.sh, please specify the path to your Quantum Espresso installation and the number of cores you intend to use.

```sh
% pwd
/home/username/qe_lk99
% ./run.sh > log &
```

Upon completion of the calculations, a band structure diagram will be outputted as a file named bands_wide.png.

# Results
## Machine Specifications and Calculation Time
The tests were conducted on a machine with the following specifications:  
OS: Ubuntu 20.04.6 LTS  
Processor: AMD Ryzen 5 PRO 4650G (3.7-4.2GHz/6 cores/12 threads/8MB cache/TDP 65W)  
Memory: DDR4-2666 16GBÃ—2 (Dual channel, Total 32GB) 

The calculation times for parallelization with 6 cores using MPI were as follows:
1. 01scf (1h35m)
2. 02nscf (2h48m)
3. 03bands (4h13m)
4. 04plotbands (7m10.92s)

## Band Structure
The following band structure was obtained.

![Band structure for the energy range from -2.0eV to 4.0eV](images/bands_wide.png)

Like the reference paper, flat bands near the Fermi level are visible.

Upon closer inspection, the following image was obtained.

![Band structure for the energy range from -0.1eV to 0.1eV](images/bands_zoom.png)

Comparing with the reference paper, it seems that the entire band is approximately 0.02eV lower. I am unsure whether this discrepancy is due to slight differences in calculation conditions or if there is an issue with the input file. If you notice anything unusual, please contact me.
